        <h3>A sketchy story on how some of Sheffield's women took to the male-dominated art of photography</h3>

      <h3>Photography - a man's world?</h3>

      <p><b><i>2018.</b></i> Cameras aplenty and photographs galore. So much so that the year gone by saw a whopping 1.2 trillion digital photographs taken worldwide. Smartphones are turning ordinary people into prolific photographers. Be that as it may, photography still seems to be a man’s world, although there’s no reason why that should be. There aren’t any eyebrows raised if women are seen taking photographs today. But the fact still stays that a disproportionate number of renowned photographers are men.</p>

      <p>Camera manufacturing giant Nikon recently ran a campaign to promote its new camera. The campaign featured as many as thirty-two photographers from across the globe, all experts in various genres of photography including wedding, nature and sports. Where Nikon went wrong was that every single one of those thirty-two photographers were men, and was hence stuck with the label ‘sexist’.</p>

      <p>It might be hard to believe the fact that we’re celebrating only a hundred years since women got the right to vote in the UK, a significant change in society in which Sheffield had a major role to play. Although very poorly documented, the story of Sheffield’s women in photography follows a similar timeline.</p>




      <h3>One of the world’s oldest photographic societies is born</h3>

      <p><b><i>1864.</b></i> Colour photography was in its infancy. Thomas Sutton had only just constructed, not clicked, the first permanent coloured photograph as we know it today. Meanwhile in Sheffield, ‘The Steel City’ was an accolade it was yet to receive, and Harry Brearley was decades away from stumbling upon a non-rusting steel in one of the town’s laboratories. Indeed, it was ancient times as far as Sheffield was concerned. But just three years after Sutton’s achievement, Sheffield witnessed the birth of one of the oldest photographic societies in the world.</p>

        <p>While the newly built Dale Dyke Dam’s reservoir was being filled up for the first time, a strong south-western gale was sufficient for the River Loxley to break its walls. What followed was one of the largest natural disasters the world had witnessed. The Great Sheffield Flood destroyed everything in its course, claiming over 240 lives and sweeping away more than 600 houses. It is believed that photographers from far and wide rushed to Sheffield to document the extent of the damage in the aftermath of the flood. And thus, they formed the Sheffield Photographic Society.</p>

        <h1>A pioneer in every sense of the word</h1>

        <p><b><i>1902.</b></i> Almost four decades after the Sheffield Photographic Society was established, it was still an all-male society. In October of that year, it finally decided to alter its rules and admit lady members. Enter Miss May Johnson, a woman way ahead of her time and, and the society’s first female member.</p>

        <p>The society’s current archivist Judy Smith came across just the one image of Miss Johnson, and a few titbits of information about her adventurous life. “Before women’s suffrage, we were considered second class,” she said. “Women were only expected to stay strictly within the confines of the house and take care of the children.” But Miss Johnson was far from the norm. A caver, a climber and a photographer as well, she was an ‘unusual’ but ‘confident’ woman as described by Judy.</p>

        <p>Known for her bravery, Miss Johnson was a part of several caving groups, most notably the British Speleological Association. In 1904, she became the first woman to descend the famous Gaping Hill in the Dales – a pothole so deep that it can fit the entire Big Ben. She painstakingly photographed the entrances to the caves she explored. When elsewhere, she encouraged the wives of the other members of the Society to try a hand at photography.  </p>

    </section>

    <section class="content">

      <p> However, she suddenly disappeared from the world of speleology in 1938. As Miss Johnson died in 1963, so did her archival record of photography, save a few prints that are currently in the Department of Local History and Archives. The Sheffield Photographic Society has been unsuccessful in finding out more about her photographs. They only hope that one day someone will come across a trunk full of her photographs, much like the legacy of American street photographer Vivian Maier was discovered. Although there's little evidence to support it, Miss Johnson is said to be Sheffield's first female photographer.</p>

      <h3>Still a rocky road for Sheffield's female photographers</h3>

      <p><b><i>1990.</b></i> Miss Johnson largely laid the path for Sheffield’s women to take up photography. Despite the lack of documentation, it is believed a lot more women took an interest towards professional photography in the city. Ninety years since Miss Johnson became a member of the Society, Judy decided to join the Sheffield Photographic Society. In her early days as a photographer, she found it strange that the Society’s then president, a man, used to pick on her and the other female members.</p>

      <p>As she took on the job of archiving after a few years, she realised how difficult it was for someone like Miss Johnson to boldly take on the art. “Photography was something that had to be done outdoors,” Judy said, “and it was unimaginable for a woman to do such a thing.”</p>

          <h2>"Women had to prove that they could compete in photography - quite like an audition in fact!"</h2>
          ~ <em>Judy Smith</em>
        </blockquote>

      <p>“And even when women like Miss Johnson began taking photographs, male members didn’t accept women initially, until they proved that they could take photographs as good as the men,” she said. “Women had to prove that they could compete – quite like an audition in fact!” she laughed. </p>

      <p>John Scholey, a fellow member of the Society and Judy’s friend, agreed. “In those days, to use those great big cameras with the cloth over the head, women needed to be confident and dominant,” he added. “They learned the art because they were determined to get involved.” Speaking of determination, as teenagers Judy and her brother would crawl on all fours through a door to sneak into a makeshift dark room. “Mind you, this room had no electricity or running water, but we developed our photographs in there,” she said. </p>

      <p>Miss Johnson's involvement in the Sheffield Photographic Society has left a lasting impression on its outlook towards photography. “She believed that the city of Sheffield must be photographed to record the changes it underwent, so that the future generation knows what life was like back in the days,” said Judy. Following Miss Johnson’s words, the Society systematically photographed buildings of Sheffield from the exact same location almost a 100 years apart for a visual comparison. The results are quite spectacular. </p>

      <h3>The state of affairs today</h3>

      <p><b><i>2018.</b></i> Times have certainly changed. It’s been just over ten years since John became a member of the Sheffield Photographic Society, and he hasn’t noticed any difference in the quality of pictures taken by its male and female members. At the Society’s exhibition at the Sheffield Cathedral in March this year, there was no separate panel of photographs that were taken only by women. A friendly Society, it welcomes both men and women today. </p>

      <p>
      The current President of the Society John Ferretti believes that a good photographer is someone who “sees something that other people might just walk past and not think that it can make a photograph.” “It’d be silly to think that only men have that ability,” he said.

    <p>There are lots of missing pieces in the story of how Sheffield’s women finally got involved in photography. Nobody knows if they ever protested to ‘win a right’ to take photographs. Nobody knows exactly when the scales began to tip in their favour. This section of Sheffield’s history remains rather fuzzy, but what’s certain is that more and more female photographers are making their mark in the industry. According to Judy, Miss Johnson’s contribution to Sheffield’s women in photography deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. She remains an unknown and mysterious figure, but one who battled the sexism to set the ball rolling for Sheffield’s women in photography.</p>
